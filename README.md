# Maximizing-Revenue-for-Cab-Drivers-Through-Payment-Type

**Description:**

This Python project analyzes taxi ride data to investigate the relationship between payment type and fare amount. By conducting an A/B test and employing hypothesis testing, we aim to determine if there is a significant difference in revenue generated by different payment methods. This analysis can provide valuable insights for cab drivers and companies to optimize their pricing strategies and maximize earnings.

**Problem Statement:**

In the competitive taxi booking sector, maximizing revenue is essential for long-term success and driver satisfaction. This project focuses on understanding whether payment methods have a significant impact on fare pricing.

**Objective:**

* Conduct an A/B test to compare the total fare amounts for credit card and cash payments.
* Utilize Python hypothesis testing to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.
* Extract valuable insights to help cab drivers optimize their revenue.

**Research Question:**

Is there a correlation between total fare amount and payment type? Can we strategically influence customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers without negatively impacting customer experience?

**Data:**

* **Dataset source:** https://data.world/vizwiz/nyc-taxi-jan-2020/workspace/file?filename=yellow_tripdata_2020-01.csv
 
**Methodology:**

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   * Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Data Exploration:**
   * Analyze the distribution of fare amounts for each payment type.
   * Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
3. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   * Formulate a null hypothesis (e.g., there is no difference in fare amounts between payment types).
   * Conduct a t-test to compare the means of the two groups.
   * Evaluate the p-value to determine if the results are statistically significant.

**Tools and Libraries:**

* **Python:**
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * SciPy (for statistical tests)
  * Matplotlib (for visualizations)
  * statsmodels
